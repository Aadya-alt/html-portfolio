<h3> Best Movies According to Aadya</h3>
<h4>My Top 3 Favorites of all time </h4>

    <h5>The Chronicles of Narnia, The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe</h5>
    <p>I really love the idea of the story, I think it is very bizarre for a country to be in a wardrobe. And my favorite character is Lucy, I like her attitude.</p>
    
    <h5>Matilda</h5>
    <p>I really enjoyed watching Matilda. She is a smart and kind girl who loves reading books. Her parents were mean, but she stayed strong. I liked how she used her powers to help Miss Honey and stop Miss Trunchbull. It was fun, exciting, and made me feel happy inside.</p>

    <h5>Wicked</h5>
        <p> I watched the movie Wicked and I really liked it! The songs were fun and the story was exciting. I liked how the witch was not really bad, just misunderstood. The colors and magic were cool. It made me feel happy and a little sad too. I want to watch it again!</p>
