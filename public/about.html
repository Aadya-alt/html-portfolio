<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Aadya. I am 12 years old and already cooler than half the internet. While most people my age are still figuring out how to not trip over their shoelaces, I’m out here scoring goals on the football field like it’s the FIFA World Cup, coding like I’m on a secret mission from the future, and gaming like I’ve been training with the Avengers. I don’t just play video games—I own them. And don’t even get me started on my love for supercars. If it’s got four wheels, a shiny body, and can go from 0 to 100 faster than I can say “homework,” then yes, I want it in my garage. I already know the names of more supercars than I know vegetables (and I plan to keep it that way, thank you very much).</p>

<p>Now, let’s talk about the things I do not vibe with. First up: vegetables. I don’t trust anything that looks like a tiny tree and tastes like sadness. Broccoli? No thanks. Carrots? Only if they’re in a cake, and even then, I’m suspicious. Spinach? That’s a hard pass. My plate is a no-veggie zone. And then there’s decorating things… like why would I waste my time color-matching curtains and fluffing pillows when I could be leveling up in a game, fixing bugs in my code, or imagining myself racing a Lamborghini down a neon-lit street in Tokyo? I believe glitter belongs in someone else's life, not mine. I’m here for tech, touchdowns, and turbo engines—not tassels.</p>
  
 

<p> So basically, I’m like a firecracker in sneakers with a brain wired for brilliance and a spirit that runs on speed. Whether I’m dodging defenders on the field or debugging a chunk of code, I do it with the confidence of someone who knows she’s going places—fast. I’m not growing up to be “just someone”—I’m leveling up like a boss in every game of life. I’ve got goals (literally and figuratively), I’ve got grit, and I’ve got a garage in my dreams that looks like a supercar showroom. So buckle up, world—I’m not just on the way. I’m already in drive.</p>
